ALWAYS HAVE YOUR TEXTBOOK AND **FLASH DRIVE OR LAPTOP** READY FOR CLASS.

# Texts
* zyBooks (e-book) - Data Structures I

    > Available through SPU bookstore. ISBN: 9781541868083

* Other readings or instructions will be provided via Canvas.

# Software
We will use [Code::Blocks](http://codeblocks.org/). for this class. It is available on all SPU computing lab machines (in Otto Miller Hall 253, all classroom computers, and the Library). You don't have to, but most of you will want to have Code::Blocks on your own computer. Good news: it is available to everyone, it's Open Source. You may want to check out this guide for Windows, and this guide for Mac on how to install and run your first program using Code::Blocks. Mac users are welcome to use Xcode, check this guide about installation and running Xcode. You will be required to know how to do command line compilation and running. Students are required to test their code both in Mac and Windows environments, code needs to run in both.

# Computers
Programming assignments may be written and run on the Windows PCs in the Otto Miller Hall Open Computer Lab (OMH 253), in the SPU Library or on your own computer. ***ALWAYS BE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR WORK*** and store incremental copies in multiple places (see “Storage Media” below). Murphy’s Law is alive and well: drives and disks only fail just prior to the due date of programming assignments.  Just storing your programs on your hard drive may not be enough! The instructor is very unlikely to perceive a dead or full disk (or even a system crash) as adequate grounds for an extension of the due date! Explicitly: There will be no extensions due to computer or storage failure.

# Storage Media
Invest in a USB flash drive so that you can back up your personal files.  Buy one, use it and carry it with you even if you are using your own laptop for your assignments (you’d be surprised how often that can be a lifesaver!). Backing up to OneDrive cloud storage is another option (you have 1TB of free space!), see here: [SPU Wiki on One Drive](https://wiki.spu.edu/display/HKB/OneDrive+for+Business).
