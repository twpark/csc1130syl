# Software

This class will be using Qt (C++ binding) for GUI framework and Qt Creator for its default IDE. If you wish this for your personal laptop, and don't already have it installed, you can obtain it for free (under LGPL License) from Qt homepage. Instructions for downloading and installing the software will be available via Canvas.

# Computers
Programming assignments may be written and run on the Windows PCs in the Otto Miller Hall Open Computer Lab (OMH 253), in the SPU Library or on your own computer. This class does not officially support MacOS/Linux, however, there are resources how to install Qt/Qt Creator on these operating systems online. Google it.

# Storage Media or Source Repo
If you do not already have a USB flash drive for storing and backing up personal files, invest in one!  USB flash drives are available for purchase all over these days, and you can get a lot of storage for pretty reasonable prices!

Otherwise, you may want to learn how to use online/local source code repository toolkits (e.g., git) and keep your codes backed up.
