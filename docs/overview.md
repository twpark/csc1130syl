# Ways of Knowing in the Sciences (WKS) Mission
Ways of Knowing in the Sciences (WKS) courses teach principles and foundational knowledge as well as technologies and important applications in different scientific disciplines. Students will explore topics using the scientific method and other tools of science (e.g., problem solving, inquiry learning) and will be encouraged to pursue lifelong scientific literacy. Students will also exam interactions between science and Christianity, including stewardship of nature.

# Course Description and Learning Objectives 
`Prerequisite: C- or better CSC 1230 Problem Solving and Programming`

Develops discipline in program design, style, debugging, testing. Introduces object-oriented design with classes, methods, and encapsulation. Introduces dynamic storage allocation and pointers. Examines arrays and linked linear data structures.

Required course for:
* BS in Computer Science
* BA in Computer Science
* BS in Information Systems
* BS in Computer Engineering
* BS in Electrical Engineering
* Computer Science Minor

## How does this class help prepare you for future success in the computing sciences? 

> Students who successfully complete this course (grade of C* or better) will be able to:

1. Apply problem-solving skills to design well-structured algorithms from problem statements.
1. Code algorithms in single- and multi-file C++ programs using good coding style and code documentation.
1. Compile, execute, test, debug, and informally verify correct operation of programs.
1. Utilize arrays and “C” strings in programs. 
1. Utilize typedef, struct, and user defined classes in programs.
1. Understand the difference between stack and heap based allocation.
1. Utilize dynamic storage allocation and pointers.
1. Articulate and apply destructors, copy constructors, and copy assignment operators when a class has pointers to allocated memory.
1. Articulate and apply the object-oriented concepts of encapsulation, information hiding, classes and methods.
1. Articulate the concept of an abstract data type (ADT).
1. Articulate the design, use, and implementation of a list ADT, including both dynamic array and linked list implementations.
1. Articulate the concept of Big-O notation and compare the efficiency of some common algorithms

### Note: while a C- or better is considered “passing”, any grade less than B- in this course should be understood to denote minimal (at best) preparation for the follow-on CSC 2431 course.
