# Assignments

## Daily Coding Workout (20%)

* Powered by zyBooks and its accompanied zyLabs, You will be provided with 50 daily coding working throughout the quarter. These are short and quick coding practice problems, coming with an autograder where you are supposed to submit your code and get graded immediately. Some coding workouts will be introduced in class and you may be able to get some time to work on it.
* The most important thing is that you SHOULD invest at least 30 minutes a day for this coding workout.
  * (1ti 4:8, NIV) For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
* So, for programming training is of some value. This will be counted toward 20% of the total credits. ***Workouts in a week is all due on Sunday night***.
*  My suggestion for the coding workout is: you write a code passing all the testcases. It may not be done at once. After you finish coding, you ***completely wipe out*** your code and start fresh. This is your second set of workout on the same day. You should be code at ease this time. If you are still not very confident after finishing your second set, you do the same thing once again. Repeat until you feel confident.

## zyBooks reading (20%)

* Every week you will have a zyBooks reading assignment, that is, you go finish reading / participating in zyBooks activities in the specified section, and submit the grade back to the canvas. You will be able to find the instruction from the canvas assignments.
* First zyBooks reading assignment will be announced at the end of the first week.

## Programming Assignments (25%)

* There will be weekly programming assignments which will be counted toward 25% of your total credit. 
* First assignment will be announced at the end of the first week.

## Quizzes and Exam (25%)

* On Fridays, at the end of the class, weekly quiz will be given. 
* As the class won't meet on 4/19, there is no quiz in that week. 
* So there will be 9 quizzes, and the final exam will be counted for the equivalent of 3 quizzes. 
* The lowest 2 quiz grades will be dropped.
* No make-ups of missed quizzes will be given unless prior arrangements are made, and then only for reasons of serious illness or emergency (the instructor decides whether it is a valid reason, so contact ahead).
* All quizzes/exams are close book activities.
* Policies for rescheduling final exams are set by the university and may be found at: http://spu.edu/catalog/university-calendar/finals-schedule. There will be no exceptions to this policy.


# Assignment Policies

One learns to program by programming. That is why programming assignments are a significant portion of your grade in this class. We can discuss ideas, demonstrate how things work and, occasionally, try things out in class, but most of the actual "learning" and skill-building, especially when it comes to coding, will occur outside of class as you apply these concepts to assigned problems.

## Submission and Late Policy

The following procedures apply to all assignments (unless specifically directed otherwise).

* **All assignments must be submitted via Canvas to be accepted**. Each assignment will have a specified due date.
    * Emailed assignments are not accepted.
* Assignments not turned in when they are due are considered late. Late assignments will receive a penalty depending on the number of days delayed:
    * -10% for less than 1 day
    * -20% for less than 2 days
    * -30% for less than 3 days
    * -40% for less than 1 week
    * -50% for more than 1 week
    * Late submissions  more than 2 weeks are not accepted.
* On Thursday June 6 at 11:59 PM, course page will be shut down and no late submissions will be accepted.

### Technical Challenge and Late Submission
Friendly Reminder: BE SURE TO ALWAYS BACK-UP YOUR WORK and store incremental copies in multiple places. Flash drives and personal laptops only fail just prior to the due date of programming assignments (or so it seems). The instructor is very unlikely to perceive a storage or system crash as adequate grounds for allowing an extension of a due date!

## General Assignment Policy
**All works are individual**: Unless otherwise noted, all work is to be done on an **individual basis**. At the same time, it is understood that learning from your peers is valid and you are encouraged to talk among yourselves about programming in general and current assignments in particular. Keep in mind, however, that each individual student must do the work in order to learn. Hence, the following guidelines are established:

* Feel free to discuss any and all programming assignments.
    * Discussion on Slack in the class channel is encouraged, to share common pattern of troubleshooting experiences and to benefit from each other.
    * However, **DO NOT** allow other students to copy your code.
    * Given that said, **DO NOT** give any student an electronic or printed copy of any program you write for this class.
* Gaining the ability to properly analyze common programming errors is an important experience. 
    * Do not deprive (too early) a fellow student of his/her opportunity to practice problem solving: control the urge to show them what to do by writing the code for them.
    * If you don't know how to do it wisely, ask the instructor or lab tutors to do it.
* If youâ€™ve given the assignment a fair effort and still need help, see the lab tutors or instructor.
* **DOUBLE ZERO for plagiarism**: If there is any evidence that a program or other written assignment was copied from another student or any source over the internet, all involved students will earn 'double zero' credit for the assignment.
    * That is, zero for the given assignment and another deduction of full credit amount of that assignment.
    * Following the university policy, the act will be automatically reported to department and dean's office.
* Protect yourself: Handle throw-away program listings carefully.
* General academic integrity policy still applies. See Classroom Policy Notes section for more details.
